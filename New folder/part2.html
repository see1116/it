        <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
        <p class="congratulations-message">
            You’ve solved the puzzle and revealed your special birthday message:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Happy 20th Birthday, My Blush!</strong><br>
            
            It’s incredible to reflect on how we went from barely knowing each other in school to discovering something truly special between us later on. Even though you often play the part of a tough, indifferent shell, I see through it and recognize the depth of your care. I cherish the moments when your true feelings are revealed, and I hold close to my heart the pure, innocent essence that shines in your eyes. Your presence in my life is something I treasure deeply.
            <br><br>
            As your personal diary, I want you to know that, Even though I’m not into promises, know that if you ever find yourself alone, I’ll always be right here beside you. You’ve been my supporter and my idiot, and I am, without a doubt, your biggest fan, Mr. All-rounder. Let’s continue to grow and transform into our best selves together.
            <br><br>
           May this year bring you all the joy, success, and fulfillment your heart desires. Here’s to celebrating you today. Wishing you a day as wonderful as you are!
